/**
 Simple wrapper for accessing accounts, getting passwords, setting passwords, and deleting passwords using the system
 Keychain on Mac OS X and iOS.
 
 This was originally inspired by EMKeychain and SDKeychain (both of which are now gone). Thanks to the authors.
 SSKeychain has since switched to a simpler implementation that was abstracted from [SSToolkit](http://sstoolk.it).
